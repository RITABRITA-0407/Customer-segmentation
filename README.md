# Customer-segmentation

🧠 Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering

📌 Project Overview
Not all customers are the same — some are big spenders, some love bargains, and some need more attention.
This project uses K-Means Clustering, a popular unsupervised learning technique, to identify distinct customer groups based on their spending habits and income levels. Perfect for businesses looking to personalize marketing strategies!
